## Hand Gesture Recognition Model

# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources to develop a hand gesture recognition model. The goal is to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, facilitating intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. Whether it's controlling devices with a wave of your hand or enabling sign language translation, this project aims to push the boundaries of gesture recognition technology.

# Key Features
Image and Video Input: Support for both static images and video streams, allowing real-time gesture recognition.
Multiple Gestures: Capable of recognizing and classifying a wide range of hand gestures, providing versatility in applications.
Deep Learning Architecture: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for robust and accurate gesture recognition.
Pre-trained Models: Includes pre-trained models for quick deployment and experimentation.
Customizable: Easily extendable and customizable for specific use cases or gestures.

# Procedure
Installation: Clone this repository to your local machine. https://github.com/STiFLeR7/Prodigy_ML_04.git
Dependencies: Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Details can be found in the requirements.txt file.
Dataset: Gather or prepare a dataset containing labeled hand gesture images or videos.
Training: Train the model using the provided scripts or pre-trained models. Fine-tune as necessary for your specific dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation scripts or custom metrics.
Integration: Integrate the trained model into your application or system for gesture recognition functionality.
